Past Projects
=============

There are a few past projects that you can use to get a feel for how :code:`8840-utils` is used.

A few of these are 8840's own robot code. Here are a few of them:

- 8840 - `8840-utils Source Code`_ - (even though this is the literal library itself, many components are used within it)
- 8840 - `2023 Robot Code`_

.. _8840-utils Source Code: 
.. _2023 Robot Code: https://github.com/frc8840/2023-Season


Using these projects
--------------------

Generally, to setup these projects are pretty simple.

First, if you have never followed :ref:`this guide<installation>` yet on installing WPILib and VSCode, do that first.

Once done, you can clone a project with:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone <.git url>

Then, open the folder in VSCode. You should be able to build and deploy the code to your robot, 
or run the simulation mode with the WPILib extension.
